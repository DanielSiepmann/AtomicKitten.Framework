Configuration
=============

.. sectionauthor:: Daniel Siepmann <coding@daniel-siepmann.de>

All configuration is done through the underlying PHP Framework `Flow <http://flowframework.io/>`_.
This way, you can find all information about locations, load order and syntax at the official
`Documentation
<http://flowframework.readthedocs.org/en/stable/TheDefinitiveGuide/PartIII/Configuration.html>`_.

Nevertheless you still find the needed information in this documentation, too.

.. _placeOfConfiguration:

Place of configuration
----------------------

Place your configuration file :file:`Settings.yaml` inside the folder :file:`Configuration` your Package 

.. _configurationOptions:

Configuration options
----------------------

The easiest way would be to copy the existing configuration file from
:file:`Packages\\Application\\AtomicKitten.Framework\\Configuration\\Settings.yaml` and edit the parts you
need. As every configuration has a default value, you will find all available configurations inside
the file. Beside the configuration path and default value, you will find documentation inside that
file what each configuration option is for.

So there will be no additional configuration here.
