-----

This is the implementation of AtomicKitten, the framework itself. It's designed to parse your
AtomicKitten and generate the static HTML.

If you are looking for AtomicKitten itself, refer to the `Github page
<https://github.com/DanielSiepmann/AtomicKitten>`_ of the project.

Goal
----

The goal is to reimplement http://patternlab.io using https://packagist.org/packages/typo3/flow as PHP Framework and https://github.com/TYPO3Fluid/Fluid as Template Engine.

Why

That should help following Atomic Design for FLOW, Neos and TYPO3 CMS solutions.
Also it will provide a more flexible way to create templates.
